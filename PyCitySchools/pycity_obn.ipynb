    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    " - Charter schools outperform district schools.  The top five schools by overall passing rate are all charter schools, while the bottom five are all district schools.  The overall passing rate for charter schools is 95%, while district schools only have a 74% overall passing rate.\n",
    " - Schools perform consistently in math and reading across grades.  This means that school data is not skewed by a higher population of any given grade, but that performance is more likely tied to the school itself.\n",
    " - A higher per-student budget does not correlate with higher performance.  In fact, some of the highest-spending schools performed the worst.  Schools with spending over \\$645 per student only had a 74\\% overall passing rate, while schools with spending less than \\$615 had a passing rate over 95\\%."
